# Workshop Content
All workshop content for Week 2 onward is located here.

Please note that the course requires students to use [Anaconda Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) as the IDE of choice. **You do not need to use this to achieve the required marks**.

All work inside of this directory was created via the standard Python console and Notepad++, however if you are unfamiliar with console usage then you should use the recommended IDE above.

For copyright purposes (and to avoid this repo getting nuked by way of DMCA), the university-supplied instructionals will not be included. Consult the 1008ENG course site to obtain these; the content in this directory applies only to Trimester 2, 2024.
