# Task Summary

## Question 1
Write a Python program with a while loop to find the smallest integer `N` such that `S = N³` is greater than a specific limit (recursive addition), `SL`. (For example, if `SL = 88,S=1³+2³+3³+4³`)

Your program must use a `while` loop and you must draw a flowchart to symbolise your logic.

## Question 2
A proud new parent decides to start an education savings plan for the child. Assume:
- He/she has $800 to get started and can contribute $120 each month.
- The interest rate depends on the balance:
	- If balance < $10000, the interest rate is 0.3% each month.
	- If $10000 ≤ balance < $20000, the interest rate is 0.4% each month.
	- If $20000 ≤ balance < $30000, the interest rate is 0.5% each month.
	- If balance ≥ $30000, the interest rate is 0.6% each month.

Write Python program with a while loop to find out how long it will take the parent to save
$40,000 for the child’s tertiary education. Use a figure to show the balance of each month for
the whole period.
