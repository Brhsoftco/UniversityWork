# Week 6 Workshop Tasks
### Problem Descriptions
#### Problem 1
Write a program that reads strings (without digits or symbols in the string) typed by the user until an empty string is entered.
For each string, convert all words to lowercase, then sort and print the words into descending order lexicographically.
Hint: use split function to split a string into a list, then sort it with a method.

#### Problem 2
Write a program that allows the user to enter two lists of integers, calculate the sum of the first and the last integers in each list, and print the larger sum.
In the event of a tie, print Same. When there is only one integer in the list, the sum is the integer itself.

#### Problem 3
We’ll say that a lowercase ’g’ in a string is ”happy” if there is another ’g’ immediately to its left or right.
Write a function to print True if all the g’s in the given string are happy, otherwise, print False.
