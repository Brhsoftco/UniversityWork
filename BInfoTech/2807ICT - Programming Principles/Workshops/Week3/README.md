# Week 3 Workshop Tasks
### Problem Descriptions
#### Problem 1
The grades at a university are awarded based on the marks awarded for the course out of 100. Marks of 85 or above receive the grade of 7. Marks less than 85 but that are 75 or above receive the grade of 6. Marks less than 75 but that are 65 or above receive the grade of 5. Marks less than 65 but that are 50 or above receive the grade of 4. Anything less than 50 gets the grade of F. Write a program that asks the user to input the marks and prints the grade awarded.

#### Problem 2
A shipping company charges its customer based on the weight of goods and the distance of shipping. A discount is given based on the distance of shipping as follows:
distance < 250km, no discount 
250km ≤ distance < 500km, 10% discount
500km ≤ distance < 1000km, 15% discount
1000km ≤ distance < 2000km, 20% discount
2000km ≤ distance < 3000km, 35% discount
3000km ≤ distance, 50% discount
The shipping cost is calculated based on the following equation: 
cost = baseprice * weight * distance * (1 - discount).
Write a program that takes as inputs the baseprice, weight, and distance, and prints the shipping cost to be charged to the customer.
