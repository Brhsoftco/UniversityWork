#### Problem 3
A primary school needs to arrange their students to sit for the National Assessment Program − Literacy and Numeracy test in multiple exam halls at Griffith University. Each school class has 25 students. A big exam hall can accommodate 45 students, and a small exam hall can accommodate 22 students. Write a program for the school to calculate how many full classes can be accommodated given the input numbers of big exam halls and small exam halls. For example, the program should look like this when run.
